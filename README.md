#Certificate Authority
This is a Drupal module with the simple purpose of creating a front end UI for me to use when creating Website SSL Certificates for my Lab environment.

I've pushed all commands to generate a certificate and key within a single, very simple, shell script.  This shell script is kept in the file system and this Drupal module simply calls that script passing the hostname I entered into the form.  

The certificate and key are provided to me as a link for me to immediately download.
